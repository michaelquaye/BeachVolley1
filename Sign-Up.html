        <p>There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.<br>
            Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.<br>
        Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that<br>
        will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.
            <ul>
                <li>For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really
                    exciting and<br> intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</li><br>
        <li>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.</li></p>
        <li>Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.</li>
    </ul>
